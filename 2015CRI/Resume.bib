	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Germline mutations within the {MEIS}-interaction domain of {HOXB}13 have implicated a critical function for {MEIS}-{HOX} interactions in prostate cancer etiology and progression.  The functional and predictive role of changes in {MEIS} expression within prostate tumor progression, however, remain largely unexplored.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: Here we utilize {RNA} expression datasets, annotated tissue microarrays, and cell-based functional assays to investigate the role of {MEIS}1 and {MEIS}2 in prostate cancer and metastatic progression.
{RESULTS}: These analyses demonstrate a stepwise decrease in the expression of both {MEIS}1 and {MEIS}2 from benign epithelia, to primary tumor, to metastatic tissues.  Positive expression of {MEIS} proteins in primary tumors, however, is associated with a lower hazard of clinical metastasis ({HR} = 0.28) after multivariable analysis.  Pathway and gene set enrichment analyses identified {MEIS}-associated networks involved in {cMYC} signaling, cellular proliferation, motility, and local tumor environment.  Depletion of {MEIS}1 and {MEIS}2 resulted in increased tumor growth over time in vivo, and decreased {MEIS} expression in both patient-derived tumors and {MEIS}-depleted cell lines was associated with increased expression of the pro-tumorigenic genes {cMYC} and {CD}142, and decreased expression of {AXIN}2, {FN}1, {ROCK}1, {SERPINE}2, {SNAI}2, and {TGFb}2.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These data implicate a functional role for {MEIS} proteins in regulating cancer progression, and support a hypothesis whereby tumor expression of {MEIS}1 and {MEIS}2 expression confers a more indolent prostate cancer phenotype, with a decreased propensity for metastatic progression.},

	abstract = {Cancer stem cells have been strongly linked to resistance and relapse in many malignancies. However, purifying them from within the bulk tumor has been challenging, so their precise genetic and functional characteristics are not well defined. The side population assay exploits the ability of some cells to efflux Hoechst dye via {ABC}-transporters. Stem cells have increased expression of these transporters and this assay has been shown to enrich for stem cells in various tissues and cancers. This study identifies the side population within a zebrafish model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and correlates the frequency of side population cells with the frequency of leukemia stem cells (more precisely referred to as leukemia propagating cells within our transplantation model). In addition, the side population within the leukemia evolves with serial transplantation, increasing in tandem with leukemia propagating cell frequency over subsequent generations. Sorted side population cells from these tumors are enriched for leukemia propagating cells and have enhanced engraftment compared to sorted non-side population cells when transplanted into syngeneic recipients. {RNA}-sequencing analysis of sorted side population cells compared to non-side population cells identified a shared expression profile within the side population and pathway analysis yielded Wnt-signaling as the most overrepresented. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that stem cell differentiation and canonical Wnt-signaling were significantly upregulated in the side population. Overall, these results demonstrate that the side population in zebrafish acute lymphoblastic leukemia significantly enriches for leukemia propagating cells and identifies the Wnt-pathway as a likely genetic driver of leukemia stem cell fate.},

	abstract = {Increased glucocorticoid receptor ({GR}) expression and activity following androgen blockade can contribute to castration-resistant prostate cancer ({CRPC}) progression. Therefore, we hypothesized that {GR} antagonism will have therapeutic benefit in {CRPC}. However, the {FDA}-approved nonselective, steroidal {GR} antagonist, mifepristone, lacks {GR} specificity, reducing its therapeutic potential. Here, we report that two novel nonsteroidal and highly selective {GR} modulators ({SGRM}), {CORT}118335 and {CORT}108297, have the ability to block {GR} activity in prostate cancer and slow {CRPC} progression. In contrast to mifepristone, these novel {SGRMs} did not affect androgen receptor ({AR}) signaling, but potently inhibited {GR} transcriptional activity. Importantly, {SGRMs} decreased {GR}-mediated tumor cell viability following {AR} blockade. In vivo, {SGRMs} significantly inhibited {CRPC} progression in high {GR}–expressing, but not in low {GR}–expressing xenograft models. Transcriptome analysis following {AR} blockade and {GR} activation revealed that these {SGRMs} block {GR}-mediated proliferative gene expression pathways. Furthermore, {GR}-regulated proliferation-associated genes {AKAP}12, {FKBP}5, {SGK}1, {CEBPD}, and {ZBTB}16 are inhibited by {CORT}108297 treatment in vivo. Together, these data suggest that {GR}-selective nonsteroidal {SGRMs} potently inhibit {GR} activity and prostate cancer growth despite {AR} pathway inhibition, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of {SGRMs} in {GR}-expressing {CRPC}.

	abstract = {Background
Kawasaki disease ({KD}) is an autoimmune disease preferentially attacking children younger than five years worldwide. So far, the principal treatment to {KD} is the administration of Intravenous immunoglobulin ({IVIG}). Although {DNA} methylation plays important regulation roles in diseases, few studies investigated the regulation roles of {DNA} methylation in {KD}.

Methods
In this study, we focused not only on the {DNA} methylation alterations resulted from {KD} onset but also on {DNA} methylation alterations resulted from {IVIG} administration. To do so, we investigated the effects of {KD}’s onset and {IVIG} administration on {CpG} marker’s methylation alterations.

Results
We first found that {DNA} methylation alterations reflecting disease onset or {IVIG} administration are contributed mainly by the {CpG} markers on autosomes. In addition, we also demonstrated that some {CpG} markers carry methylation alteration among samples, forcing the expression abundance of the downstream genes to be also altered and negatively correlated with methylation profile. Finally, compared with {KD}’s onset, {IVIG} administration brings stronger impact on methylation alteration. And, such alterations were conducted mainly by hyper-methylating {CpG} markers, forcing the corresponding genes to keep lower expression levels. Moreover, the genes regulated by the altered {CpG} markers with {IVIG} administration are enriched in the pathways associated with inflammatory immune response.

Conclusions
In summary, our result provides researchers with another way into the regulation mechanism through which {IVIG} represses excessive inflammatory responses.},

	abstract = {Kawasaki disease ({KD}) or Kawasaki syndrome is known as a vasculitis of small to medium-sized vessels, and coronary arteries are predominantly involved in childhood. Generally, 20–25\% of untreated with {IVIG} and 3–5\% of treated {KD} patients have been developed coronary artery lesions ({CALs}), such as dilatation and aneurysm. Understanding how coronary artery aneurysms ({CAAs}) are established and maintained in {KD} patients is therefore of great importance. Upon our previous genotyping data of 157 valid {KD} subjects, a genome-wide association study ({GWAS}) has been conducted among 11 (7\%) {CAA}-developed {KD} patients to reveal five significant genetic variants passed pre-defined thresholds and resulted in two novel susceptibility protein-coding genes, which are {NEBL} (rs16921209 (P = 7.44 × 10−9; {OR} = 32.22) and rs7922552 (P = 8.43 × 10−9; {OR} = 32.0)) and {TUBA}3C (rs17076896 (P = 8.04 × 10−9; {OR} = 21.03)). Their known functions have been reported to associate with cardiac muscle and tubulin, respectively. As a result, this might imply their putative roles of establishing {CAAs} during {KD} progression. Additionally, various model analyses have been utilized to determine dominant and recessive inheritance patterns of identified susceptibility mutations. Finally, all susceptibility genes hit by significant genetic variants were further investigated and the top three representative gene-ontology ({GO}) clusters were regulation of cell projection organization, neuron recognition, and peptidyl-threonine phosphorylation. Our results help to depict the potential routes of the pathogenesis of {CAAs} in {KD} patients and will facilitate researchers to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of {KD} in personalized medicine.},

In contrast, little is known about the {APCs} that regulate {CD}8+ T cell responses against hematological malignancies. Using an unbiased approach, we aimed to characterize the {APCs} responsible for regulating {CD}8+ T cell responses in a syngeneic murine leukemia model. We show with single-cell resolution that {CD}8α+ {DCs} alone acquire and cross-present leukemia Ags in vivo, culminating in the induction of leukemia-specific {CD}8+ T cell tolerance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mere acquisition of leukemia cell cargo is associated with a unique transcriptional program that may be important in regulating tolerogenic {CD}8α+ {DC} functions in mice with leukemia. Finally, we show that systemic {CD}8α+ {DC} activation with a {TLR}3 agonist completely prevents their ability to generate leukemia-specific {CD}8+ T cell tolerance in vivo, resulting instead in the induction of potent antileukemia T cell immunity and prolonged survival of leukemia-bearing mice.

Using a mouse model that targets the Tpp1 gene and recapitulates the pathology and clinical features of the human disease, we analyzed end-stage (4 months) transcriptional changes associated with lack of {TPP}1 activity. Using {RNA} sequencing technology, Tpp1 expression changes in the forebrain/midbrain and cerebellum of 4-month-old homozygotes were compared with strain-related controls. Transcriptional changes were found in 510 and 1,550 gene transcripts in forebrain/midbrain and cerebellum, respectively, from Tpp1-deficient brain tissues when compared with age-matched controls. Analysis of the differentially expressed genes using the Ingenuity™ pathway software, revealed increased neuroinflammation activity in microglia and astrocytes that could lead to neuronal dysfunction, particularly in the cerebellum. We also observed upregulation in the production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species; activation of leukocyte extravasation signals and complement pathways; and downregulation of major transcription factors involved in control of circadian rhythm. Several of these expression changes were confirmed by independent quantitative polymerase chain reaction and histological analysis by {mRNA} in situ hybridization, which allowed for an in-depth anatomical analysis of the pathology and provided independent confirmation of at least two of the major networks affected in this model. The identification of differentially expressed genes has revealed new lines of investigation for this complex disorder that may lead to novel therapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {To ensure proper gene regulation within constrained nuclear space, chromosomes facilitate access to transcribed regions, while compactly packaging all other information. Recent studies revealed that chromosomes are organized into megabase-scale domains that demarcate active and inactive genetic elements, suggesting that compartmentalization is important for genome function. Here, we show that very specific long-range interactions are anchored by cohesin/{CTCF} sites, but not cohesin-only or {CTCF}-only sites, to form a hierarchy of chromosomal loops. These loops demarcate topological domains and form intricate internal structures within them. Post-mitotic nuclei deficient for functional cohesin exhibit global architectural changes associated with loss of cohesin/{CTCF} contacts and relaxation of topological domains. Transcriptional analysis shows that this cohesin-dependent perturbation of domain organization leads to widespread gene deregulation of both cohesin-bound and non-bound genes. Our data thereby support a role for cohesin in the global organization of domain structure and suggest that domains function to stabilize the transcriptional programmes within them.},
